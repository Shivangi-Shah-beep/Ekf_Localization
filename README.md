# EKF Localization - Probabilistic Robotics

## Overview
This repository implements **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) localization** for a mobile robot using **ROS**. The project integrates vision-based landmark detection and sensor fusion techniques to estimate the robot's position in a simulated environment.

## Features
- **EKF-based localization** for accurate state estimation.
- **Landmark-based perception** using feature detection.
- **Sensor fusion** integrating odometry and vision-based measurements.
- **Gazebo simulation support** for real-world testing.


## Dependencies & Credits
This repository **uses models and environment assets** from the original **[prob_rob_labs](https://github.com/ihadzic/prob_rob_labs)** repository. Please ensure all dependencies are installed before running the simulation.
